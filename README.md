Simple SEIR model for infectious disease modeling.

This project involves the creation of a basic shiny app that uses the SEIR compartmental model to model infectious diseases.The app enables a user to select inputs, explore the disease dynamics based on the selected plot, explore the simulated data, and download the simulated data for further analysis.
